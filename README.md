_Computerflow is a final project for Informatics Engineering Bachlor's degree._

_It's goal is to develop software able to provide an intuitive and interactive Interface for users that require usage of data flow programming without having extensive programming knowledge._

Edit:
In order to start the electron app, the user should go to the directory of the project and insert the command:
"$ electron ."
In future version, the app will be build to prevent this from happening.
Since the project is still in progress, it is not needed to do this step for now.
